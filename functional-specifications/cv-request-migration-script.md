## Summary
This script has the following key features:

* Keeps a running total of all un-migrated cv requests in the room since the user has joined.
* Highlights cv request messages when they are completed.
* Background refresh to find completed cv requests in chat, with visual aid

## Background

The Room Owners of SOCVR need a way to keep close vote requests from cluttering the transcript. At first we were manually checking and moving requests to the Graveyard. The next solution was to use a script that activily searches through close requests. This works, but can cause throttling.
