# User Scripts


This repository contains various [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) user scripts that add features to the review queue or to the chat room.

## SO Close Vote Request Generator
This script sends a `[tag:cv-pls]` message to the site's chatroom for the post you are currently viewing. It works on `*.stackexchange.com` and `*.stackoverflow.com` at the moment.

To set the target chat room: <sup><sub>(saved on a per-site basis)</sub></sup>

1. Select <kbd>Set Room</kbd> from the <kbd>cv-pls</kbd> menu (located in the post menu)
2. Paste the URL of the target room into the dialog.
  * The default room is SO Close Vote Reviewers.

This setting will be saved for the site that you set it on only.

To send a request:

1. To open the reason prompt you can either:
  *  Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>
  *  Or select <kbd>Send request</kbd> from the <kbd>cv-pls</kbd> menu.
2. Enter your reason into the prompt (anything that is acceptable in chat is acceptable in the reason dialog).
3. Click <kbd>OK</kbd> on the prompt or press <kbd>enter</kbd> on your keyboard to submit the request. 
  * Clicking on the <kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>Cancel</kbd> in the dialog will cancel the request.

Requests generated by this script will be in the following format:

    [tag:cv-pls] reason [title](url) - [user](url) time
