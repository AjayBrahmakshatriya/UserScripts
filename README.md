# User Scripts


This repository contains various [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) user scripts that add features to the review queue or to the chat room.

## SO Close Vote Request Generator
This script sends a `[tag:cv-pls]` message to the site's chatroom for the post you are currently viewing. It works on `*.stackexchange.com` and `*.stackoverflow.com` at the moment.

###Installation
To install this script [click here](https://rawgit.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/UserScripts/master/SECloseVoteRequestGenerator.user.js) or otherwise visit the following URL, and GreaseMonkey/TamperMonkey should ask you to install it.

     https://rawgit.com/SO-Close-Vote-Reviewers/UserScripts/master/SECloseVoteRequestGenerator.user.js
     
###Updating
This script has an auto-update feature. It will check for a new version every time the script is run, don't worry it is a very lightweight request.

To update manually you can visit the above URL again, or select <kbd>Check for updates</kbd> from the <kbd>cv-pls</kbd> menu.

###Target Chat Room
The default chat room is [SO Close Vote Reviewers](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers). When you change the target chat room, it will save the change for that site. Per-site metas and Stack Exchange sub domains will all be able to have their own setting.

The room URL that you enter into the prompt *must* be a valid chatroom URL. The script *will* yell at you if it is not. 

1. Select <kbd>Set Room</kbd> from the <kbd>cv-pls</kbd> menu (located in the post menu)
2. Paste the URL of the target room and click <kbd>submit</kbd>.
  * The default room is SO Close Vote Reviewers.

###Sending Requests
Requests generated by this script will be in the following format:

    [tag:cv-pls] reason [title](url) - [user](url) time
    
They can also be sent whether you are in the target room or not, as long as you have write access. 

1. Select <kbd>Send request</kbd> from the <kbd>cv-pls</kbd> menu.
  *  Or press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>
2. Enter your reason into the input provided.
  *  Any markdown that is acceptable in chat is acceptable in the reason dialog.
3. Click <kbd>Submit</kbd> or press <kbd>enter</kbd> to submit the request. 

###Short Reasons
This script has a short reason replacement feature. Basically what this means is that if you submit a one-letter reason and it matches a predefined short reason, the script will replace that letter with its corresponding reason.
* `t: too broad` 
* `u: unclear`
* `p: pob`
* `d: duplicate`
* `m: no mcve`
* `r: no repro`
* `s: superuser`
* `f: serverfault`
