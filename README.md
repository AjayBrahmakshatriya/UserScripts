# User Scripts


This repository contains various [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) user scripts that add features to the review queue or to the chat room.

## SO Close Vote Request Generator
This script sends a `[tag:cv-pls]` message to the site's chatroom of the post you are currently on. It works on `*.stackexchange.com` and `*.stackoverflow.com` at the moment.

How to work this:

1. Open the reason prompt:
  *  Press `ctrl + shift + a`
  *  Or select `[Send Request]` from the `[cv-pls]` menu (located in the post menu)
2. Enter your reason into the prompt. Anything that is acceptable in chat is acceptable in the reason dialog.
3. Click `[OK]` or press enter on your keyboard to submit the request. Clicking on the `[X]` or `[Cancel]` will cancel the request.
4. This script will send the request to the SO Close Vote Reviewers room.

To change the target chat room:
1. Select `[Set Room]` from the `[cv-pls]` menu.
2. Past the URL of the room you would like to send the requests to in the dialog. This setting will be saved for the site that you set it on only.

Requests generated by this script will follow the following format:

    [tag:cv-pls] reason [title](url) - [user](url) time
